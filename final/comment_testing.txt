Bee Movie Script # i got bored so i just did this
# The only thing that should go through is the title and a few \n or spaces

# (Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)
### NARRATOR: According to all known laws of aviation there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
###
# Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
#### The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
